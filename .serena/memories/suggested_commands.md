## Common Development Workflow
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Make changes
3. Lint code: `npm run lint`

## Notes
- No testing framework is currently set up
- No formatter (like Prettier) is configured - ESLint handles basic formatting
- TypeScript compilation is checked as part of the build process
